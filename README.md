# ChessCLI

Websocket server for multiplayer chess in the command line. I have no idea why I made this.

## Try out the tester
Go to testclient/index.html and open it in a web browser, I think that should work.

That's assuming the server is up. It's deployed on a free azure app service, so i don't know about the uptime
